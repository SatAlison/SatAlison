### 📊 Alison's Data Analytics Journey

<details>
 <summary><h3>My Journey into Data Analytics</h3></summary>

My journey into data analytics started when I noticed how quickly the world was moving toward technology. I wanted to blend my finance background with this new wave of tech to create something more powerful—something that could help organizations and even countries make better decisions and improve communities. 

I'm especially passionate about promoting digital literacy and economic development in Burundi, and data analytics felt like the perfect way to make that happen. With each new skill I learn, whether it’s Python or data visualization, I’m more excited about using data to uncover insights that can really make a difference. 

This journey is just getting started, but I’m eager to continue learning and find new ways to use data for good.
